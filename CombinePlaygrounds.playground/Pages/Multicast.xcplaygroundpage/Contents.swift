 Let's say we have some heavy tasks we want to complete, we are going to represent it by two different functions mutating a value.

/*:
 Using a CurrentValueSubject means there is a buffer for the last event and it must have an initial value, here we give it an instance of `Void`.
 This means when connecting using `then` we will immediatly receive a `Void` event which will trigger the first and second operation and once both completed the end.
 But this does not include the event sent when `deferredBegin` is executed, which trigger a new event from the multicast.

 Now there is also a way to create a multicast where all subscribers receive a different subject, but we will ignore this one ðŸ™ˆ.
 We might get back to it once we understand the inside and out of the `Subscriber` protocol.

 > It is worth mentionning the `share` operator, which is similar to multicast, could be used in our example.

 `share` returns a class wrapping of our publisher to enable attaching multiple subscribers to it.

 But let's look at this `connect` functionality, this seems like something that could be usefull not only to multicast.
