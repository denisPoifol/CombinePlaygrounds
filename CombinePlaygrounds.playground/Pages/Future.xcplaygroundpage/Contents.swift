/*:
 The second thing that is bothering me, is that we are mapping over a container of void `.map { _ in` our ignored parameter here is `()` which seems a little disgraceful to me. One of two things happened :
 - I just did not manage to found the operator that just ignores the value sent
 - Combine developpers thought that it was not worth the trouble

 A possibility would be to create our custom operator that does not take into account the value it receives, that we could call `then`.

 One common problem when creating such a flow of operation is that we often want to perform a couple of operations and once they succeed perform another one on top of it, and that is when the framework begins to feel useful because you don't have to manage dispatch group, mutex or semaphore. You can just find the precious function that does it all for you, sit back and relax. ðŸ˜Ž 

 Combine do have that magic function that is going to solve our problems, remember when we said publishers behave like sequences and benefit from many common function, well it's time to go and find the zip operator.

/*:
 It's worth noticing that in contrary to other Promises frameworks such as PromiseKit, our final publisher here is not a `Future`. In our final example we end up with a `Combine.Publishers.Map<Combine.Publishers.Zip<Combine.Future<Void, Never>, Combine.Future<Void, Never>>, Void>` which if it were exposed as part of an API would probably be erased to an AnyPublisher. This unfortunatelly means your final type does not reflect that you are manipulating a `Publisher` that behaves like a `Future`.

 Indeed **most** operators will conserve the `Future` property because **most** operators change the Output of our publisher but do not add published events. Which means **most of the time**, when you start with a `Future` you end up with a `Publisher` that also publishes one value then finishes, or immediately fails, but definitely not always.

 Next we are going to talk about handling when and how your `Publisher` sends events, but first why you might need it and for that we are going to discuss side effects and multicast.
