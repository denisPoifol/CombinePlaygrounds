 `Sink` was a good practice to implement our first ever subscriber, the simplicity mostly comes from the fact that we directly request an unlimited number of values

 But let's look closely how `Subscribers.Demand` works.

 ## 2 Subscribers.Demand

 To understand how demands works let's create a subscriber that request no value but also provide for a method to request values

 As you can see requesting values is purely additive, you cannot request 5 values then change your mind and request only 3 instead.

 ðŸ˜± I did not expected a crash from this. What's causing this !?

 This is due to a bug of the implementation of `PassThroughSubject` and `CurrentValueSubject` if you want to know a bit more about it you can look [here](NativeSubjectsCrash)

 To fix this we are just going to request `.max(1)` value instead of `.none` upon subscription

 Here we can see that the behaviour is different than when we were subscribing to `(1...).publisher`.

 If we dont request values but some are sent by the subscriber, they are not saved for the next time we request value, they are just dropped.
