# CombinePlaygrounds

Here is playground that should read as book about the Combine framework, but with the added benefit that it is a playground.

It should enable you to discover Combine by playing with it and going through simple exemples.

This does not have the pretention to cover all of combine, I do hope to find the time to add more content to it in the future.

If you see a mistake or something that seems imprecise do not hesitate to reach out to me, either by opening an issue or directly through twitter. I am definetly open to any feedback you might have.

This is free to use for everyone.
